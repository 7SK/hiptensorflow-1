# hipTensorflow: the HIP Port of Tensorflow #


## Introduction ##

This repository hosts the HIP port of [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) (or hipTensorflow, for short). For details on HIP, please refer [here](https://github.com/GPUOpen-ProfessionalCompute-Tools/HIP). Optimized DNN library calls (via [MIOpen](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/MIOpen)) are also supported within this codebase.

## Installation ##
